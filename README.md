# Autocomplete Archive

MFA Design and Technology, Parsons The New School for Design

**Thesis Studio 2** | Faculty: Sven Travis and Loretta Wolozin

Spring, 2015

This project will build an archive of daily Google Autocomplete predictions, for multiple countries and products — web, Google Images, Youtube, etc. Users can have access to this information both through a physical and a digital output. The former will be a collection of printed books using curated subsets of this data — predictions by country, letter, day, service, etc. The latter will be a web app that allows for multiple ways to retrieve, sort, and filter the database.

Previous projects include:

* [Google Alphabet](https://github.com/gianordoli/google_alphabet)
* [Google Supersearch](https://github.com/gianordoli/google_supersearch)
* [Google ABC Book](https://github.com/gianordoli/google_abc_book)
