## Concept Statement

In digital systems, we access information through databases and software. Graphical interfaces help make this process friendly and seamless. However, they might also prevent us from understanding how these systems actually work.

This project will build an archive of daily Google Autocomplete predictions, for multiple countries and products — web, Google Images, Youtube, etc. Users can have access to this information both through a physical and a digital output. The former will be a collection of printed books using curated subsets of this data — predictions by country, letter, day, service, etc. The latter will be a web app that allows for multiple ways to retrieve, sort, and filter the database.

The purpose is that by experimenting with — and experiencing — this data in different forms, users might question their own knowledge of it.
